React:
======

 - JavaScript library used to create websites
 - Open source library for building user interfaces.
 - Created by Facebook.
 - Component Based Architecture.


Setup Reactor APP:
==================

 - install node
 - cd /Users/nithiyanandhan/IdeaProjects/WebTechnology/ReactJS
 - npx create-react-app first-project

 - npm run start
 - npm install  -> install all the dependency. like pom.xml reload



Folder Structure:
=================

- node_modules
   - all dependency present in this folder

- public
   - all public files to the browser present here
   - it contains index.html , all react files will be injected to this main file.
   - index.html is the only html file in our application. 
   - No change required in this file. Because react will control the UI.


- src
   - all source code present inside this folder

- src/index.js
   - starting point for the application
   - Render the App component to the root element in index.html
   - Below code inject the App component to 'root' element in index.html.
   - App component will be coming from App.js

   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
    root.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
         <App />
      </React.StrictMode>
    );

- src/App.js
   - Root component
   - initially rendeered in html
   - If we make multiple component, we nest those component under this App.js

- package.json
   - list all the dependency required for this project.



Components:
=============

  - Component is core of react.
  - website made of react contain several component.
  - Eg: in facebook page, "Like" is one component, "share" is one component etc.,
  - Each component has separate logic and template.
  - Components can be nested.
  - Component code will be in .js file.
  - Two types of Component:
       - Stateless Functional Component 
          - eg: JavaScript Function. 
             function Welcome(props){
               return <h1>Hello,{props.name}</h1>
             }
       - Stateful Class Component 
          - Class extending Component Class. 
          - Render method returning HTML
          - class Welcome extends React.Component {
            render(){
               return <h1> Hello, {this.props.name} </h1>
            }
          }

Functional Component:
----------------------
  - It take Properties(props) as input and run javascript function and give HTML(JSX) back.
  - Refer Greet.js in first-project , which is example of functional component.
  - It cannot maintain state.

Class Component:
-----------------
  - Basically its ES6 class.
  - Optional receives properties as input and return HTML(JSX) as output. 
  - It maintain the state
  - Refer Welcome.js in first-project, which is example of class component.


Hooks:
=========
  - Hooks are the new feature that let you use state and other React feature without writing a class.
  - Currently in React 16.4.0-alpha.

JSX:
=====
   - JSX stands for JavaScriptXML - Extenstion to JavaScript language Syntax.
   - JSX allows to create HTML style template.
   - Write XML like code for elements and components.
   - in background ,it converts all JSX to pure JavaSCript.
   - like XML, JSX tags will have tagname, attributes, children.
   - JSX is not necessity to write React application but it makes react code simpler and elegant.
   - eg: Hello.js in first-project is example of react with JSX

Props:
======
   - Component can be re-used multiple times. 
   - Props used to pass attributes to the Components. 
   - Refer "GreetProps.js" in the first-project module for functional component.
   - Refer "WelcomeProps.js" in the first-project module for Class component.
   - Props are immutable.
   - Passsing method as props : refer ParentComponent.js & ChildComponent.js , greetParent method is passed as props to childComponent.js

State:
=======
   - Props get passed to the component whereas state is managed within the component. 
   - Variable declated in the function body. 
   - State can be changed. 
   - State can be accessed using:
       - useState Hook - Functional Component
       - this.state - Class Component
   - Refer Message.js in the first-project module.
   - Using State , we can change the value/state of the component. 
   - In above example, initially it shows some text but after click the button same component shows different value. 
   - Refer Counter.js for how to setState . 
   - Always make use of setState . Never modify the state directly. 
   - If Code has to be executed after the state has been updated, then place that code in call back function which is second argument to the setState method.

Event Handling:
===============
  - Refer FunctionClick.js in first-project for handling event in function component. 
  - Refer ClassClick.js in first-project for handling event in Class component.

Conditional Rendering:
=======================
  - Populate UI based on condition.
  - Refer UserGreeting.js

List & Keys:
===========
  - Refer NameList.js & Person.js
  - <Person key={x.id} personProps={x}/> . here key is unique to each element in the array. Without key , we will see warning in the console "NameList.js:21 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
  - key is not accessible in the child component.
  - Key Prop is used internally to populate the list efficiently.
  - If key is duplicated, we can see the warning in the console.
  - If you dont have unique key, add index value which will generate unique value.

Styling & CSS Basics:
======================
  - We can to Styling in React in below ways:
      - CSS stylesheets
      - Inline Styling
      - CSS Modules 
      - CSS in JS Libraries
      - Refer Stylesheet.js, Inline.js , appStyles.css , appStyles.modules.css

Form Handling:
==============
  - Refer Form.js


LifeCycle Method:
==================
  - Its avaialble only in class component. not in functional component.
  - Classify to 4 phases:
     - Mounting : 
           - When an instance of component is being created and inserted into the DOM
           - constructor(), static getDerivedStateFromprops(), render() and componentDidMount()
     - Updating : 
           - When a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
           - static getDerivedStateFromProps, shouldComponentUpdate, render, getSnapshotBeforeupdate, componentDidUpdate
           
     - Unmounting : 
           - When a componet is being removed from the DOM
           - componentWillUnmount
     - Error Handling : 
           - When there is an error during rendering , in a lifecycle method , or in the constructor of any child component. 
           - static getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch
