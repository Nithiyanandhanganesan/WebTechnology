Polymer:
=============
Polymer is a new open source library made for using Web Components to build web applications.
It is similar to React in that it is a library and not a complete framework.
It approximates features like the Shadow DOM, Templates, and HTML imports via JavaScript libraries called polyfills so that you can start
building custom elements today that will be forward compatible with Web Components in the future.
As of version 10, Polymer has the following element lines:

- Google Web Components: Wrappers for Google’s extensive suite of apps, APIs, and services (i.e., Google Maps, YouTube, and Google Analytics)
- App Elements: Elements for building full web apps out of custom modular elements (i.e., app routing and storage)
- Iron Elements: Elements for building the core functionality and structural layout of a web app
- Paper Elements: Visual elements that build off of the support provided by iron elements and implement Google’s Responsive Material Design paradigm
- Gold Elements: Elements for adding e-commerce functionality to your website (i.e., checkout flows)
- Neon Elements: Elements for adding special effects (i.e., animations)
- Platinum Elements: Elements for more complex features like Bluetooth and push notifications
- Molecules: Wrappers for external JavaScript lib


Bootstrap:
==============
Bootstrap started at Twitter as an internal style guide. It is designed to get developers on pace with their new website as quickly
and efficiently as possible. Here are some features provided by Bootstrap:

- Open-sourced full (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) front-end framework
- CSS preprocessor: Sass (support for the Less preprocessor ended with Bootstrap 3)
- 12-column grid system
- “Mobile-first” responsive design
- Optional Flexible Box (or, flexbox) support, a CSS3 mode that arranges elements on a page dynamically so they stack or expand when viewed
  on different screen sizes
- ES6 JavaScript components and plugins
- Support for IE9+ (support for IE8 ended with Bootstrap 3)
- Pre-styled, ready-to-use UI components


Angular:
===============
Angular is an in-depth, comprehensive framework developed by Google that will give you everything you need to set up the front end side of a website.
Angular manipulates DOM by extending HTML with directives. Anything that changes in the view also changes in the data, thanks to the two-way data binding.

- Dependency injection
- Two-way data binding
- A solid templating engine
- On-board form validation
- Angular directives

React:
===============

Let's call React what it is: an open-source library for rendering views with JavaScript. It stores two copies of a virtual DOM, including a second
updated version that reflects changes fed in from the view. React is best when the developer has a good amount of dynamic content changing within the view,
such as social media networks (obviously, because React was developed by Facebook). Perhaps this is why it is called 'React,' because the quick reaction
to change can save even a half second of delay in rendering.
