React Native:
==============


 - React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
   and the app platformâ€™s native capabilities.
 - Developed by Meta , designed for building cross-platform apps.
 - React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks.
 - In Android and iOS development, a "view" is the basic building block of UI
 - In Android development, you write views in Kotlin or Java; in iOS development,
    you use Swift or Objective-C.
   With React Native, you can invoke these views with JavaScript using React components.
