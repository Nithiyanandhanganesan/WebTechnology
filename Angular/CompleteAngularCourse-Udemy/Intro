Angular:
  - framework for building client application in HTML, CSS and Javascript/Typescript.

Architecture:
-------------
                  API request
  Front end      ------------- >           Backend
   (Client)      <------------      (Data and processing)
  (HTML, CSS
   ,Typescript)

Install Angular:
------------------
- install latest version of nodejs(run time environment for running Javascript outside browser) from nodejs.org website.
- install the libraries using node package manager(npm)
- sudo npm install -g @angular/cli  [ it gives boilerplate angular code.]
- create new project from cli
    -> ng new hello-world
    -> open  visual code & press shift + command + P (it will open the command pallette)
    -> type code & select "Install code command in PATH" option.
    -> now go to the terminal and move the project folder
    -> type "code ."
    -> it will open the project in the visual code.
    -> to deploy the code in server enter "ng serve"
    -> it will give the host and port (http://localhost:4200/)

Project Structure:
===================

hello-world
  - e2e [ it will have end to end test case for application ]
  - node_modules [ it will have all the third party library which application depends on]
  - src [ it will have source code for the application]
      - app
      - assets            [ store static asset of the application like images,icons etc.,]
      - environments      [ store configuration settings for different environment]
      - favicon.ico       [ icon displayed in the browser]
      - index.html
      - main.ts           [ starting point of application. its Typescript file.]
      - polyfills.ts      [ bridge the gap between js and browser by downloading the required libraries]
      - style.css         [ Global CSS for the application]
      - test.ts           [ used of testing environment]
  - .angular-cli.json     [ configuration file]
  - .editorconfig         [ all team members use the same editor configuration]
  - .gitignore            [ exclude file while commit to git]
  - karma.conf.js         [ test runner of js code]
  - package.json          [ libraries and dependencies were mentioned here]
  - protractor.conf.js    [ running end to end test case]
  - tsconfig.json         [ setting for typescript compiler]
  - tslint.json           [ setting for tslint]

Once we save the changes, webpack will automatically compile the changes and in browser we can see the changes without refreshing the browser.
